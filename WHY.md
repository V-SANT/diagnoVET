# Why Document: Diagnostic Template System

## 1. The Problem
Veterinarians face unnecessary cognitive load and repetitive tasks when creating reports.

- Redundancy: Re-typing identical structures for common cases.

- Inconsistency: Diagnostic language varies between professionals, affecting report uniformity.

- Fatigue: Manual entry increases consultation time and mental drain.

## 2. The Solution
A comprehensive Template System allowing users to insert, create, and manage predefined text snippets directly within the diagnosis editor.

- Quick Insert: Dropdown menu to replace or populate the diagnosis field.

- On-the-fly Creation: A modal to save current text as a new template without leaving the patient screen.

- Management: Easy deletion of obsolete templates.

## 3. Value Proposition
- Efficiency: Drastically reduces reporting time (seconds vs. minutes).

- Consistency: Ensures professional, standardized terminology across the clinic.

- Focus: Frees clinicians to focus on medical analysis rather than typing.

## 4. Key Requirements
- Immediate Access: "New Template" button must be accessible directly in the editor toolbar.

- Workflow Flexibility: Templates should support overwriting existing text for quick corrections.

- Usability: Creation modal must capture current editor text and be clearly readable (dark text on light background).

## 5. Success Metrics
- Adoption: High percentage of diagnoses created using templates.

- Speed: Measurable decrease in average time spent on the "Presumptive Diagnosis" screen.

- Growth: Continuous increase in the user/clinic template library.
